<span style="font-size: 0.91em;">I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University, advised by Dr. Debdeep Pati. Before joining Texas A&M, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees in statistics at the Department of Statistics, University of Calcutta and St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, respectively.</span>  

<span style="font-size: 0.91em;">My research focuses on developing novel methodologies for efficient Bayesian computation, approximate Bayesian inference, and advancing survey methodology,  with applications in biomedicine and oral health.</span>  

<span style="font-size: 0.91em;">Outside of work, I'm usually in the kitchen experimenting with recipes, sketching in my notebook, or watching a movie on OTT!<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">
